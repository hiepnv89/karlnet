Hi! This is the karlnet source tree.
karlnet consists of nodes, which are (normally) batter powered sensor devices, transmitting data at some
interval back to a base station.  The base station handles decoding the binary wire formats, and posts all
the data onto a stomp message bus topic. (the base station is a data producer)  Then whatever consumers
wish, simply subscribe to the topic.

common - headers and things for packet definitions, etc
producers - software that can produce data to stick into karlnet, (xbee receiver)
consumers - software that makes use of karlnet data (rrd, webpages, etc)
nodes - firmware that runs on the wireless nodes
