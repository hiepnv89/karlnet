Code for dealing with serial streams to and from xbees.

justwatchserial.py - watches for xbee rx 16bit addressing frames on a serial port, decodes them
and posts all messages to the bus
injector.py - creates xbee tx 16 bit address frames, and sends them out via a serially connected
xbee.

An upstart script is included to get this started, and keep it started. 

Requirements:
  * serial port with xbee attached, or xbee compatible emulator
  * stomp broker active. (activemq or similar) (if you want to run in live mode)
