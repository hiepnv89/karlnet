The main, and normally, the only producer.  This code expects to listen to a
serial port with a directly connected xbee.  It listens for rx 16bit
addressing frames (as sent by of the karlnet nodes) and decodes the wire
formats and applies any dataprocessing, before posting it all to the message
bus.

An upstart script is included to get this started, and keep it started. 

Requirements:
  * serial port with xbee attached
  * stomp broker active. (activemq or similar)
