karlnet data producers

 Producers all push jsonpickle'd "human packets" onto the stomp message bus.

 Human packets are defined in ../common/kpacket.py, but basically contain a node id, a timestamp, and a
set of sensor readings. (with type and units) The producer should also take care of any signal conditioning necessary to
turn the raw sensor readings into humanly useful readings.
