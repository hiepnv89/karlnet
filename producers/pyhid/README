You'll need pyusb 1.x from: http://pyusb.wiki.sourceforge.net/
I used pyusb-1.0.0-a0, and just ran the regular python setup.py install.

I did that before I had libusb-1.0 installed.

Steps for getting libusb-1.0 on windows.... (at least, what worked for me)

1. from http://www.libusb.org/wiki/windows_backend 
   That's from libusb itself.  NOT from libusb-win32.
2. get the latest package, I used 2010.05.17(pbr277)
3. for me, on winxp (32bit) I copied libusb-1.0.dll and libusb-1.0.lib from
   the MS32\dll directory, over to \windows\system32


Verified working on ubuntu 9.10 (with libusb-1.0-0) as well as windows xp
