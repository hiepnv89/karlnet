* Make possible option for connecting preregulated 3.3V
* add pins for the 3v3/ground, so you can use the onboard reg, or supply your
own regulated supply

* Make possible option for powering input channels from MCU, instead of
permanently wired to VCC


* avrdude doesn't recognise the board when the xbee is plugged in.  Something to do with the SPI lines :(

* Channel value pins should have been wired to the sleeve in the schematic,
but are wired to the tip.  (For compatibility with the other probes I made.
 (fixed in v2e)
