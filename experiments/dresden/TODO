v02 bugs
* avr mosi connected to ICSP 5v pin
* ICSP MOSI pin disconnected
* breakout drills are too small for regular pin headers
* board is too wide to plug into a breadboard
* dresden drills are too small for socket pins!
* samtec headers are much taller than necessary (about twice as much)
* samtec headers have much longer pins than necessary (about twice as much)

all but headers fixed for v3c.
