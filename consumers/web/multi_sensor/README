Very very basic webpage that autoupdates a graph plotting all data received from karlnet since the page was opened.
This is mostly just a testbed for learning the graphing at present.  Of course, eventually, I want to be able to pull in historical data.



 The data is read off via websockets, talking
to a stomp server.  There's basically NO support for browsers that don't support websockets.  And NO support for browsers that can't connect 
to port 61613/61614 (jms/stomp)  I really should fix that, but this was mostly just a test bed.

(to use stomp with websockets with activemq, you need 5.4-SNAPSHOT or higher.)
